I am a data scientist in DC with way too many hobbies.

For me, this site will serve a few purposes:

-   A **passion project portfolio**, detailing work in soccer analytics and other topics,
-   A **celebration of personal accomplishments**, be it my career, my golf game, or my personal life, and
-   A **forward-facing journal** of what's going on in my life and how I'm feeling about it.

If you would like to work with me, feel free to reach out to my e-mail or any of my socials.

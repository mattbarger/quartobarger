    "text": "Things I‚Äôm Enjoying at the Moment\nReturning to Weightlifting from Injury\nAbout a month ago, I had knee pain for the first time after a routine clean and jerk. Two days later, I couldn‚Äôt put pressure on my right leg. Setting up an emergency appointment, my physical therapist said a tear was unlikely: despite the pain I could still move the knee and the leg.\nI limped into the holidays hoping that the knee would heal itself. It was promising: I walked 18 holes of golf with my dad, my mobility exercisees were surprisingly good. But when the pain flared up again, I bit the bullet and scheduled an orthopedist appointment, getting myself ready to accept that I‚Äôll be another 37-year-old with knee surgery.\nLuckily, all x-rays were positive!\nBuilding a Clean Home\nI‚Äôve never been a tidy person; ask anyone who has lived with me. However, starting the new year with a new apartment has pushed me to challenge that assumption. This is my first new apartment in ten years! If I couldn‚Äôt keep the home clean, that fresh start would feel wasted.\nWell, it took two full weekends of hard work, but I cleaned the crap out of this place. Honestly, sitting in a clean home is just ego-boosting. When I look at a tidy shelf, I feel relieved and I remind myself that I‚Äôm capable of making myself feel that way. It‚Äôs a good feeling, and it feels like something to maintain."

Then I was sad.\nFor me, any kind of self-improvement comes with a counterweight of self-loathing urgency. That is, ‚ÄúI want to be able to develop this new habit, therefore I must do it immediately because everything is so awful!!!!!‚Äù This urgency comes from scarcity mindset, the idea that time is running out and if I want to be the best human possible, I need to start waking up at 6, nailing promotions and accolades, and sprinting through marathons all at the same time.\nFor a while, this motivation worked, but only for short-term lapses. Through tons of experience, I‚Äôve slowly learned that real progress comes through:\n\naccepting how far I‚Äôve come (I‚Äôm not starting from scratch and I‚Äôm not an absolute failure)\ncelebrating my growth and learning from my mistakes (I‚Äôve already done a lot toward this goal, and I‚Äôve made plenty of mistakes, too.)\ntrusting myself to stay present and keep executing, leave the future for the future.
